# Rainbow Orbit: Color Collision Game Blueprint

## 1. Overview
"Rainbow Orbit" is a high-performance, visually stunning web game where players protect an evolving central core. The game leverages modern web standards (Baseline), including Web Components, Canvas API, and advanced CSS (OKLCH, Container Queries).

## 2. Detailed Outline & Current State

### Visual Design & Aesthetics
*   **Color Palette:** Utilizing `oklch` for ultra-vibrant, perceptually uniform colors.
*   **Effects:** Glow, Depth (shadows), and Texture (noise) for a premium feel.
*   **Orbit Guideline:** A thin, dashed line marking the shield's rotation path for better precision.
*   **Dynamic Overlays:** High-contrast, blurred overlays for start and game-over states.

### Features
*   **Evolving Core:** Central circle changes color in the rainbow sequence.
*   **Kinetic Shield:** Mouse/touch-controlled arc for reflection.
*   **Real-Time Progressive Speed Physics:** Enemies speed up dynamically based on merges and time elapsed.
*   **Dynamic Difficulty:** Both spawn rate and enemy speed scale with `totalMerges` and `gameTime`.
*   **Unified Render Engine:** Sync via `requestAnimationFrame` for maximum performance.
*   **Nickname System:** Players enter a custom nickname before starting.
*   **Local Leaderboard:** Persistent top 10 rankings stored via `localStorage`.

## 3. Implementation Plan (Phase 2: Modernization)

### Step 4: Physics & Collision Refinement (Optimized)
*   **Dynamic Speed Scaling:** Implemented `getCurrentSpeed()` logic with a more accessible difficulty curve.
*   **Reduced Piecewise Progression:** Base speed reduced to **200**. Speed increases by +8/sec initially, slowing to +4/sec (at 500+), +2/sec (at 600+), and **+1/sec (at 700+)**.
*   **Merge Bonus:** Speed increase per merge reduced to **+5** for a smoother experience.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Streamlined render loop and removed redundant variables/logic to ensure 60FPS on all devices.
*   **Real-Time Updates:** Enemies now update their velocity every frame to reflect global speed changes immediately.

### Step 5: Enhanced Touch Support & Mobile Optimization
*   **Absolute Pointer Tracking:** Shield follows the finger/mouse position exactly for maximum intuition.
*   **Haptic Feedback:** Integrated the Vibration API to provide tactile feedback during merges and game-over states.
*   **Fullscreen Mode:** Implemented request for fullscreen mode upon game initiation.
*   **Responsive UI:** Optimized HUD and Overlay for various screen sizes.

### Step 6: Difficulty Rebalancing (Requested)
*   **Spawn Frequency Reduction:** Reduced frequency to 80% of the previous state (interval increased by 1.25x). `baseSpawnRate` updated from 0.875 to **1.09375**.
*   **Speed Progression Halved:** The dynamic speed increase per second has been reduced by 50% across all speed tiers (e.g., initial increase reduced from +4/sec to **+2/sec**).
*   **Merge Bonus Adjustment:** Speed bonus per successful merge maintained at a lower level for consistency.

### Step 7: Core & Shield Refinement (Requested)
*   **Initial Core Size Reduction:** Reduced the starting radius of the central core from 25 to **18** for a more challenging start.
*   **Dynamic Core Growth:** Each successful merge now increases the core radius by **5%** (`*= 1.05`), providing a more visible sense of progression.
*   **Precision Shield Collision:** Enhanced the collision detection algorithm. The angular check now incorporates the enemy's radius relative to the shield distance (`arcLength / 2 + atan(radius / distance)`), ensuring hits at the very tips of the shield are accurately reflected.

### Step 8: Conditional Difficulty Scaling (Updated)
*   **Speed-Triggered Spawn Intervals:**
    *   At speed **360**, the spawn interval is set to **0.7s**.
    *   At speed **430**, the spawn interval is set to **0.6s**.
    *   At speed **500**, the spawn interval is set to **0.5s**.
*   **Aggressive Late-Game Challenge:** Starting from speed **500**, every **3 seconds** elapsed, the spawn interval decreases by **0.01s** until it reaches a minimum of **0.35s**.
*   **Simultaneous Arrival Prevention:** A robust spacing logic ensures that balls never reach the central core at the same time by maintaining a minimum arrival time gap.
*   **Speed & Core Plateau:** Speed increases halt at **500+** and core growth halts at score **170+** to maintain gameplay balance.

### Step 9: Nickname & Leaderboard (Requested)
*   **Nickname Input:** Added a text input field to the start screen with a 10-character limit.
*   **Score Persistence:** Implemented `updateLeaderboard()` using `localStorage` to save the player's name and score. This ensures entries are permanently stored in the user's browser until displaced from the top 10 by a higher score.
*   **Top 10 Display:** The game-over screen now displays a sorted list of the top 10 orbital pilots.

### Step 10: GameDistribution SDK Integration
*   **SDK Setup:** Integrated the GameDistribution HTML5 SDK for cross-platform monetization and distribution.
*   **Game ID:** Configured with the specific Game ID `b2a0dfd7914b40d99441eb8d12fbf2f4`.
*   **Lifecycle Management:** Implemented `pause()` and `resume()` logic to handle `SDK_GAME_PAUSE` and `SDK_GAME_START` events, ensuring the game state is preserved during advertisements.
